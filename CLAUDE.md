# Notes for Claude (maintainers' sessions)

## Handling issues

Problem reports from the panel arrive as public issues on odtu/PowerLabKiCadAssistant.

1. Fix the problem, verify it, and push the fix with `Fixes #N` in the commit message.
2. **Always reply on the issue** after a fix: what went wrong, which commit fixed it, how it was verified, and what the reporter must do to get it (usually: pull, close KiCad, rerun `install.ps1`).
3. **Post replies as `github-actions[bot]`, never under a maintainer's personal account.** Don't use a GitHub tool or `gh issue comment` that posts as the signed-in user. Write the reply to a file and run the `reply-to-issue.yml` workflow:

   ```powershell
   gh workflow run reply-to-issue.yml -R odtu/PowerLabKiCadAssistant -f issue=N -F body=@reply.md
   ```

   Add `-f close=true` to close the issue too. Use `-F body=@file`: Windows PowerShell 5.1 mangles quotes in inline arguments. After the run, check the comment author is `github-actions[bot]`.
4. Issues and replies are public. Never quote project, board, sheet or part names, net names or file contents from a user's design in a reply.

## Working on the code

- Tests: `"C:\Program Files\KiCad\10.0\bin\python.exe" -m unittest discover -s tests` (KiCad's Python has wx and pcbnew).
- `install.ps1` / `uninstall.ps1` must stay plain ASCII and run on Windows PowerShell 5.1. Under `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`, redirecting a native command's stderr (`*> $null`, `2>&1`) throws; run such checks through `Probe`.
- The panel promises users that nothing about their projects reaches METU Power Lab. Anything added to problem reports must go through `report.scrub`, and must never include messages, Claude's replies, selection, clipboard, or project/part/net names.
